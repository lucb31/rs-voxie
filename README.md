# 🛠️ RustCraft — A Minecraft Clone in Rust

### General
- 🎯 **Summer 2025 Side Project**
- 🧱 A simple Minecraft-style voxel engine built using **Rust** and **OpenGL bindings**.
- 🔧 Focused on learning and experimentation — not a full game (yet).

### Goals
- 🚀 Learn **Rust** through a practical, graphics-heavy project.
- 🎨 Deepen understanding of **3D rendering with OpenGL**.
- 🔍 Explore and evaluate **Rust OpenGL bindings** (like `gl`, `glium`, etc.).

## 📦 Project Status

🛠️ Work in progress. Currently focused on:
- [x] Basic window setup with glutin & imgui
- [x] Loading shaders
- [x] Rendering cubes
- [x] Rendering shaded cubes
  - [x] Primitive directional light source 
  - [x] Fixed light direction along camera axis
  - [x] Absolute light direction in world space
- [ ] Rendering textured cubes
- [x] Basic camera movement (WASD + mouse)
- [x] Advanced camera movement (Control speed & sensitivity via UI)
- [x] Hold MIDDLE mouse to pan camera
- [x] Camera debug info(position & rot)
- [ ] Simple world chunk generation

## 🙋‍♂️ Notes to Self

- This project is primarily for learning — code quality will improve over time.
- Try to write clean, idiomatic Rust, but don’t stress perfection on the first pass.
- Commit often. Break things. Have fun.
